....Task 2: Comparative Analysis on Unsupervised Machine Learning on Clustering Algorithms....
========================================


 
OBJECTIVE AND SUB TASK DETAILS OF TASK2:
 

The primary objective of Task2 is to implement a Comparative Analysis on Two Unsupervised 
Machine Learning Clustering Algorithms between K-means and DBSCAN for clustering the Nursery 
application dataset(Malik, A., & Tuckfield, B. (2019)). Nursery-Application Dataset 
is downloaded from UCI Machine Learning repository which is a hierarchical ranking 
decision-making model originally developed and used in 1980's. The goal is to identify 
natural groupings and gain insights on underlying patterns and relationships between 
nursery applications within the 9 attributes of the dataset where the selection process 
is logically more centered around the 'class' attribute.

For K-means: Objectives A, B & C are implemented. 
For DBSCAN: Objective D, E & F are implemented.

Objective-A: K-means Clustering applied between 9 Variables 
Objective-B: K-means Clustering applied between 4 Variables 
Objective-C: K-means Clustering applied between 2 Variables  
Objective-D: DBSCAN Clustering applied between 9 Variables 
Objective-E: DBSCAN Clustering applied between 3 Variables 
Objective-F: DBSACAN Clustering applied between 2 Variables
